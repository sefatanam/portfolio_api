    "description": "Self-learned full-stack developer. Have an open-source community @nixgram on GitHub to help junior geeks. Work with versatile technology because that's my dream. Try to build up a habit to know what's going on under the hood until things do not seem like magic. Ask me about .NET, Angular, React & Ionic. Love ❤ to develop cross-platform desktop, web & phone application."
